Weather project by Rudolf JozanoviÄ‡
-----------------------------------

To run this you will need:
 -php 5.3+
    -php-mysql
    -php-curl
 -mysql

 Installation:
 -------------
 There is no need to run composer as there are no dependencies. You do however need to create an empty database
 and a user that has permissions to read/write from it:

 To do this you can just run bellow SQLs:
  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS maidea_rudolf_jozanovic;
  CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'maidea_rj'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON maidea_rudolf_jozanovic.* TO 'maidea_rj'@'localhost';

 If you want to use different name for database or user you will need to update config.json as well.

 Database will be automatically populated with tables and required data the first time you run anything.
